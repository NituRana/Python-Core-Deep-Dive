Project Overview: Python Deep Dive
The project will be a modular, well-documented Python package that explores core Python concepts in a structured, code-first way. Each module will focus on a specific topic, with explanations, examples, and exercises.

Suggested Modules and Topics
Basic Data Types

Module Name: basic_data_types
Topics:
Numbers (integers, floats, complex)
Strings (immutability, basic methods)
Booleans
Goal: Implement a script that handles different data types, showing type conversions and operations between them.
Collections

Module Name: collections
Topics:
Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
List Comprehensions
Goal: Create an example where each data structure is the best tool for the job (e.g., managing a catalog of items).
Functions and Lambda Expressions

Module Name: functions
Topics:
Defining Functions with parameters and return types
Lambda Expressions
map(), filter(), and reduce()
Goal: Demonstrate map, filter, and reduce through examples such as processing lists or applying operations to data in a pipeline.
Classes and Objects

Module Name: oop_basics
Topics:
Classes and Instances
Attributes and Methods
Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
Goal: Create a basic object-oriented structure (e.g., a Library management system with books, members, and librarians as classes).
Advanced Object-Oriented Concepts

Module Name: oop_advanced
Topics:
Decorators and Static/Class Methods
Magic (Dunder) Methods (e.g., __str__, __repr__, __add__)
Duck Typing
Metaclasses
Goal: Develop a class that uses multiple dunder methods and a metaclass to demonstrate Python's dynamic typing capabilities.
Iterators and Generators

Module Name: iterators_generators
Topics:
Iterators and the iterator protocol
Generators (using yield for lazy evaluation)
Goal: Implement a custom iterator and a generator to handle large datasets efficiently.
Decorators

Module Name: decorators
Topics:
Function Decorators
Class Decorators
Goal: Create decorators for logging, caching, or timing functions. You might build a decorator for retrying a function upon failure, for example.
Error Handling and Exceptions

Module Name: error_handling
Topics:
Exception Types (e.g., ValueError, TypeError)
Custom Exceptions
Using try, except, else, and finally
Goal: Create a set of custom error handlers for a mock application.
File Handling and Context Managers

Module Name: file_handling
Topics:
File I/O (open, read, write)
Context Managers (with statement)
Goal: Implement a context manager that reads a configuration file safely, automatically closing the file.
Signals and Events in Python

Module Name: signals
Topics:
Signals (introduction to signaling and event handling in Python)
Implementing custom signals for notifying certain events.
Goal: Create a small event-driven system where certain actions trigger signals (e.g., a login system that sends a notification upon successful login).
Advanced Concepts and Metaprogramming

Module Name: advanced_python
Topics:
Meta classes (creating classes dynamically)
Introspection (using type(), isinstance(), hasattr())
Reflection
Goal: Implement a factory pattern using metaclasses to demonstrate how classes can be dynamically created.

Each module should include:

Documentation: Clear descriptions of the topic and the code purpose.
Example Code: Working examples with explanations of the output.
Exercises: Self-contained exercises or small projects for hands-on practice.
Extras
To further improve your learning, consider:

Unit Tests: Write test cases for each module in the tests/ folder.
Documentation: Add a README.md in each module folder to summarize the concepts.
Interactive Notebooks: Create Jupyter notebooks for specific modules to run code examples interactively.
